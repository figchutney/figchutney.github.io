Iâ€™m **Ben Watson** - a **software engineer** - primarily working in **Python**.

I'm **based in London** (well, near enough anyway), and have been building software for 3-4 years. Most recently I've worked at [Zoa](http://zoa.io) - who are building consumer energy tech - and [Bulb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulb_Energy) - the energy company (RIP).
