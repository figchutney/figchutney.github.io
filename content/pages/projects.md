A collection of little hobby projects, each inspired by *"would be cool if there was a little app that did that!"* conversations with people.

**[`wainlog`](https://github.com/figchutney/wainlog)**: a Lake District summit tracker written with `FastAPI` and `PostgreSQL`. Uses `Google OAuth2` for auth. [Deployed on Digital Ocean](https://wainlog-8drtz.ondigitalocean.app/)

**[`fagiolo`](https://github.com/figchutney/fagiolo)**: a deliberately simple meal planner written with `Flask`.

**[`mixoni`](https://github.com/figchutney/mixoni)**: a 'couple-of-hours' project - a tiny `Flask` app which tells you which cocktails you can make based on what ingredients you have. [Deployed on Heroku](https://mixoni.herokuapp.com/).
